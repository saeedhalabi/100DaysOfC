# 100 Days of C 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of C** challenge!  
This repository documents my journey learning the C programming language — one day at a time.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
I want to build a strong foundation in systems programming and understand how computers really work.  
C is the perfect language to master memory, performance, and logic.

## 📅 The Plan
- Code in C **every day** (even small programs count!)
- Learn one new concept or solve one problem each day
- Push my progress to GitHub daily to stay consistent
- Build small projects as I go

## 📘 Progress Log

| Day | Topic / What I Learned | Code |
|-----|-------------------------|------|
| 1 | Hello World & Variables | [day01](day01) |
| 2 | Function & Library + IDE | [day02](day02) |
| 3 | Data types (part 1) | [day03](day03) |
| 4 | Data types (part 2) | [day04](day04) |

*(I’ll update this table every few days.)*

## ⚙️ Tools & Setup
- Compiler: `gcc` or `clang`
- Editor: VS Code / Vim / CLion
- OS: Linux / macOS / Windows (WSL)
- Git for version control

## 🌟 Goals
- Develop strong fundamentals in C
- Build 3–5 mini projects by the end
- Maintain consistency and discipline
