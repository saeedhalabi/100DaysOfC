# Conditional Statements – Day 10

This lesson focuses on using conditional statements in programming, specifically the `if` and `if–else` structures. Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on given conditions.

## 🧩 What is an `if` Statement?

An `if` statement checks a condition.  
If the condition is **true**, the code inside the `if` block will run.

## 🔀 What is an `if–else` Statement?

An `if–else` statement provides an alternative.  
If the condition is **true**, the `if` block executes.  
If the condition is **false**, the `else` block runs, giving the end-user additional or fallback information.

## 🧱 Syntax

```c
if (condition)
{
    // statements to run if condition is true
}
else
{
    // statements to run if condition is false (failure message or alternative action)
}
