## Topic: Modify Operators (`++` and `--`)

Today I learned about the **increment** and **decrement** operators in C.  
These operators are used to quickly **increase or decrease** the value of a variable.

---

## 🔢 Increment Operator (`++`)
### **Pre-increment (`++x`)**
- Increases the value *before* the expression is evaluated.

### **Post-increment (`x++`)**
- Increases the value *after* the expression is evaluated.

---

## ➖ Decrement Operator (`--`)
### **Pre-decrement (`--x`)**
- Decreases the value before use.

### **Post-decrement (`x--`)**
- Decreases the value after use.

## 🧪 Code Example
See the file: `day9_modify_operators.c`

## 💡 Summary Table

| Operator | Operation | Pre | Post |
|---------|-----------|-----|------|
| `++` | Add 1 | change then use | use then change |
| `--` | Subtract 1 | change then use | use then change |

## 🎯 What I Learned Today
- Difference between **pre** and **post** increment/decrement  
- How these operators behave inside expressions  
- How to test them with `printf` to see the order of operations
