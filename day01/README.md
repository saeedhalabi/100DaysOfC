# Day 1 — Hello, World!

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to write and compile a simple C program using `gcc`.
- Basic structure of a C program: `#include`, `main()`, and `return`.
- How to print text to the console with `printf`.

## 🧠 Thoughts
Starting small but strong! It feels great to see that first “Hello, world!” message on screen.
