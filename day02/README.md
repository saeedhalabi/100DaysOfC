## 📅 Day 2 — Function, Function Definition and Function Call

### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- **What is a Function?**  
  A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. It helps make programs modular and easier to manage.
  
- **Types of Functions**
  - **Library Functions** – Built-in functions provided by C (e.g., `printf()`, `scanf()`).
  - **User-Defined Functions** – Functions written by the programmer.

- **Function Components**
  - **Declaration (Prototype):** Tells the compiler about a function’s name, return type, and parameters.  
    ```c
    int add(int a, int b);
    ```
  - **Definition:** Contains the actual code that defines what the function does.  
    ```c
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    ```
  - **Call:** Executes the function in your program.  
    ```c
    int sum = add(5, 10);
    ```

### 🗒️ Notes
- Today’s session was focused on understanding the **theory** behind functions — no coding examples were written yet.
- Learned why functions make code reusable and easier to debug.
